    <h2>
    The McGoff Group is thrilled to announce its partnership with Stewart and Jeannie Pickering, the duo and founders of the highly successful kidsunlimited brand, and the launch of a brand new day nursery in Altrincham; Back to the Garden Childcare.
</h2>
    <h3>The new venture marks the return of Stewart and Jeannie to the child care sector, with the couple re-entering the marketplace after 10 years following the sale of kidsunlimited in 2008. Whilst at the helm of kidsunlimited, they opened more than 50 full day care nurseries, which were in short supply, and introduced the first on site ‘workplace’ nurseries in the North West for firms such as HSBC.
      <br />
<br />
    The concept for Back to the Garden will challenge the current childcare provision in the country. With new build there is an opportunity to significantly improve the economic footprint of nurseries with a design that is environmentally, economically and even socially more sustainable. The setting of the nursery is also significant. Back to the Garden will occupy a spacious and safe corner of the site, with the location strategically chosen to answer national Government calls to position child care facilities away from busy main roads, where elevated levels of pollution are more and more often being linked to hindered general development and the increase in childhood asthma, plus other health related issues. According to a Greenpeace investigation, 35 nurseries in Greater Manchester are located close to roads that break the legal pollution limits.

In addition to the purpose-built nursery, the expertly designed garden and extensive external space will provide an opportunity for children to explore and discover in a natural, safe and stimulating environment, benefiting from a beautiful landscaped setting, a gardening and planting patch, large playground and all-weather play areas. It is this emphasis on outdoor play and the setting of the nursery that will stand Back to the Garden apart from competitors.

We are proud to be partnering up with Stewart and Jeannie, who are pioneers in this sector, and firmly believe that we are creating a dream team operator for Back to the Garden Childcare.”
