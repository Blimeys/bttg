    <h2>
    Back to the Garden Childcare is a brand new day nursery, opening in Altrincham in late July 2018. The nursery is located on Sinderland Road in Broadheath and will offer 120 places for children ranging in age from 3 months old up to the age of five.
</h2>
<h3>
    Back to the Garden is a joint venture between the McGoff Group and Stewart and Jeannie Pickering, the founders of the highly successful kidsunlimited brand. Both parties bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to the partnership, and the launch of Back to the Garden later this year will deliver child-centred care and education equal to the highest quality available.
</h3>
<h3>
    With an innovative and  creative approach to early childhood education, drawing inspiration from the Reggio Emilia pre-schools and the Forest Schools’ philosophy, at Back to the Garden Childcare we are creating an environment which encourages collaboration, communication and exploration through a child-led approach with the adult taking the role of mentor and guide.
</h3>
<h3>
    Our philosophy focuses on the health and wellbeing of each and every child with a specially designed menu, working with nutritionalists and wherever possible, using organic or locally grown produce.
</h3>
<h3>
    It is the impressive external space and the nursery’s emphasis on health and wellbeing that will form the heart of Back to the Garden. The beautiful landscaped setting will provide an opportunity for the children to explore and discover in a natural, safe and stimulating environment, benefiting from a gardening and planting patch, a large playground and European-inspired all-weather play areas.
</h3>
    <h2>Construction of the nursery will be complete in July 2018.</h2>

In addition to the purpose-built nursery, the expertly designed garden and extensive external space will provide an opportunity for children to explore and discover in a natural, safe and stimulating environment, benefiting from a beautiful landscaped setting, a gardening and planting patch, large playground and all-weather play areas. It is this emphasis on outdoor play and the setting of the nursery that will stand Back to the Garden apart from competitors.

        "The success of New Care over the last few years, combining our property and construction expertise to acquire, design, build and operate purpose-built care homes, has undoubtedly encouraged the Group to take the next natural step into operational child care. We are proud to be partnering up with Stewart and Jeannie, who are pioneers in this sector, and firmly believe that we are creating a dream team operator for Back to the Garden Childcare.”
